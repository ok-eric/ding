ding - an experiment on leveling up programming skills

# What?
Purpose is to create a program that only exists as a foundation for learning the basics of a new programming language and promotes discovery of the most powerful components of a new programming language.  Simplicity and functionality tests are the backbone.

Not intended for aspiring computer scientists. Intended for users who are very strong in a language and have the desire to branch out (but not the time)
